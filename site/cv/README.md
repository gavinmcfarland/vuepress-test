## Highlights {.f-caps .f-1}

- Implementing design thinking process within analytics optmisation team helped contribute to continued YoY growth of accquisition by over 300%.
- Research of the John Lewis iPad App showed that customers’ browsing habits were not fully supported. I organised workshops and tested new designs with customers. We succeeded in driving changes to the navigation and browsing of content which substantially increased sales and downloads. The iPad App gained a 4.5 rating on the App store.
- Working with Venntro I helped to increase the number of complete profiles on their dating platform. To start only a small percentage of customers completed their profile. I interviewed customers to understand their dating habits and assessed usability pain points. By introducing users to the profile creation process earlier on we increased completed profiles by 4 times of what it was before.
